# iTerm2 Multi-Session MCP Server

This is a fork of the original [iterm-mcp repository](https://github.com/pashpashpash/iterm-mcp), heavily modified and tested for use with Cline to provide robust, multi-session iTerm2 control.

**This tool is for macOS only.** Windows users should refer to the original repository.

## ðŸš¨ WARNING: ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE ðŸš¨

This software is of ALPHA quality. By using this tool, you acknowledge and accept **ALL THE RISKS OF LETTING AN AI CONTROL YOUR TERMINAL SESSIONS.** The user is solely responsible for monitoring the AI's actions and ensuring the safety and integrity of their system. Start with focused, simple tasks and always supervise the AI's behavior.

## Features

*   **True Multi-Session Control:** Launch, manage, and interact with multiple, independent iTerm2 sessions simultaneously.
*   **Configurable & Sandboxed:** Control which iTerm profiles the AI can access via a simple JSON configuration file. It is strongly recommended to use dedicated, sandboxed profiles with limited permissions for AI use.
*   **REPL Support:** Launch sessions with specific profiles designed to start a REPL, such as for Python or Julia, enabling powerful, environment-specific automation.
*   **Tested with Cline:** This fork has been tested with Cline to ensure stability and reliability across various edge cases.

## Safety & Configuration

This MCP will only control iTerm sessions that are launched with a profile name listed in the `iterm_mcp_settings.json` file. Furthermore, all safety checks (like closing a session) rely on the profile name starting with a configurable prefix (default: `"MCP_"`).

It is **highly recommended** to create specific iTerm profiles for the AI that are sandboxed or have limited permissions. Do not give the AI access to profiles with broad administrative privileges unless you fully understand and accept the risks.

### `iterm_mcp_settings.json`

Create this file in the root of the `iterm-mcp` project directory to configure the server:

```json
{
  "mcp_prefix": "MCP_",
  "mcp_profiles": [
    "MCP_CONTROLLED",
    "MCP_PYTHON",
    "MCP_JULIA"
  ]
}
```

*   `mcp_prefix`: A safety prefix used to identify all sessions controlled by this MCP.
*   `mcp_profiles`: A list of the exact profile names that the AI is allowed to launch.

## Tools

*   `get_mcp_profiles`: Returns a list of the available MCP profiles that can be launched.
*   `launch_session`: Launches a new iTerm2 session with a specific, allowed profile.
*   `close_session`: Closes a specific MCP-controlled iTerm2 session by its TTY.
*   `list_sessions`: Lists all active iTerm2 sessions managed by this MCP (matching the prefix).
*   `list_all_sessions`: Lists all iTerm2 sessions regardless of controllability.
*   `write_to_terminal`: Writes text to a specific iTerm terminal, identified by its TTY.
*   `read_terminal_output`: Reads output from a specific iTerm terminal.
*   `send_control_character`: Sends a control character to a specific iTerm terminal.
